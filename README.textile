h1. Breach

h2. Inspired from the game Portal, from Valve

Breach is an attempt to recreate the core experience of the game Portal from Valve.

The experience uses some OpenGL techniques to achieve the visual experience of a _spacial breach_ in the world (a teleportation tunnel toward another place).
Those techniques are described in the @RENDERING.textile@ file.

h2. Evolution

h3. Eventual goal

Breach will become a puzzle game.
It will leverage multiple kinds of breaches:
* Uni/bi-directionnal
* Static, user controlled
* Small for objects, or big enough for the player
* Filtering by kind of objects
* Two breaches only, many interlinked breaches
* Grouped, linking toward a random destination breach

h3. Current status

I didn't go very far yet.
I experienced the following:
* Lightning
* Player motion (space like, no gravity)
* Camera motion
* Click shooting/selection
* Outline of hidden breach
* Transparent breach, showing what's behind

h3. Forthcoming

* Linking of two breaches, displaying the actual other end

h3. Later future

* Physics
* Chiptune soundtrack!
