		<h1><a id="top">Breach - A (soon to be) 3D spacial puzzle</a></h1>
		<p>
		Like any project, in order to grasp what it is... you have to skip the boring lines and skip to the <a href="#what">eye-catching lists</a> or the <a href="#screenshots">screenshots</a>! ;-)<br/>
		If you're a geek, you may be interested in <a href="#geek">technical details</a>.
		</p>

		<h2><a id="inspired">Inspired from the game Portal, from Valve.</a></h2>
		<p>
		Breach is an attempt to recreate the core experience of the game Portal from Valve.
		</p>
		<p>
		The experience uses some OpenGL techniques to achieve the visual experience of a spacial breach in the world (a teleportation tunnel toward another place).
		</p>

		<h2><a id="warnings">Pre-alpha early-stage bleeding-edge experiment, proof of concept, open source and free software</a></h2>
		<pre style="margin-bottom: 0">THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR

		<span style="font-style: italic">(I finally find the caps words from open source licences very funny and sometimes quite accurate!)</span>
		</p>
		<p>
		You have been warned! This project is personnal and recreational.<br/>
		However, rather than just keeping it for myself, I decided to make it live in the real world, out in the open...<br/>
		In the open indeed, this projets is licenced under the new BSD licence and is therefore. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Hosted by GitHub, you can find the development webpages here: <a href="https://github.com/ofavre/Breach">https://github.com/ofavre/Breach</a>.
		</p>

		<h2><a id="goal">Eventual goal</a></h2>
		<p>
		Like any free software this project has its own philosophy, bringing a better world is its sole goal.<br/>
		This project will use two approaches to reach this ultimate utopia: knowledge and fun!
		</p>
		<p>
		<a id="goal-knowledge"><span style="font-weight: bold">Knowledge</span></a> is important, without it the only thing you can do is... getting some.<br/>
		As any open source software, the knowledge part comes with your right to study its source code.<br/>
		You I remind you that sources are quickly and easily browsable online? Simply head toward <a href="https://github.com/ofavre/Breach">https://github.com/ofavre/Breach</a>, it's straightforward, on GitHub the project homepage exposes the source right away.<br/>
		Should you be a git user, a read-only access can easily be gained from your desktop through the following commands:
		</p>
		<pre class="block" style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">git clone https://github.com/ofavre/Breach.git Breach</pre>
		<p>or a bit faster, using the native git protocol (may not work if your network administrator is paranoid):</p>
		<pre class="block" style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">git clone git://github.com/ofavre/Breach.git Breach</pre>
		<p>
		Unfortunately, you cannot gain write access that easily.<br/>
		To become a contributor, you should ask the project owner. But you know, humans are not reliable...<br/>
		This is why GitHub is so useful. In addition to making source easily available and easying community creation,
		it enables <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> to benefit from these services as easily: <span style="text-decoration: underline">any project is just a fork away</span>!<br/>
		After forking Breach, you will own a copy of it, which you will be the owner of!
		</p>
		<p>
		<a id="goal-fun"><span style="font-weight: bold">Fun</span></a> is equally important to each and every one of us.<br/>
		Even the most boresome person you may encounter takes great pleasure at his daily routine.
		He simply does not call it fun because he sees people &quot;having fun&quot; crazy people, but that routine is <span style="font-style: italic">his</span> fun.<br/>
		I am having fun building this project, I hope you will have fun studying it (in its early stage) and playing it (in a more mature stage).<br/>
		Enough pseudo philosophical bla bla, let's be pragmatic and unveil what's hidden under this enigmatic name!
		</p>

		<h1><a id="what">Hey, what is this stuff?</a></h1>
		<p>
		Breach will become a 3D spacial puzzle game.<br/>
		It is inspired by the game <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/portal.html">Portal from Valve</a>.<br/>
		But you've guessed it, this game has nothing to do with its famous big brother: we're talking about <span style="font-style: italic">breaches</span>, not portals!
		</p>
		<p>
		It will leverage multiple kinds of breaches:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-top: -0.5em">
			<li>Uni- or bi-directionnal</li>
			<li>Static or user controlled</li>
			<li>Small for objects or big enough for the player</li>
			<li>Filtering by kind of objects</li>
			<li>Two breaches only or many interlinked breaches</li>
			<li>Grouped breaches, linking toward a random destination</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a id="status">Current status</a></h2>
		<p>
		As an OpenGL learner myself, I didnâ€™t go very far yet.<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
		I have experienced the following:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-top: -0.5em">
			<li>Rendering engine higher level layer</li>
			<li>Lighting</li>
			<li>Player motion (space like, no gravity, no collision test)</li>
			<li>Camera motion</li>
			<li>Click shooting/selection</li>
			<li>Outline of hidden breach</li>
			<li>Transparent breach, showing another world behind (also visible by walking around the breach for now)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a id="forthcoming">Forthcoming</a></h2>
		<p>
		Here is my big lines todo list:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-top: -0.5em">
			<li>Shooting breaches</li>
			<li>Linking of two breaches, displaying the actual other end</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a id="future">Later future</a></h2>
		<p>
		Another part of my todo list, but this may take more time:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-top: -0.5em">
			<li>Collision test</li>
			<li>Physics</li>
			<li>Chiptune soundtrack!</li>
		</ul>

		<h1><a id="screenshots">Screenshots</a></h1>
		<p>
		Yes, I guess it's time for screenshots, too.
		</p>
		<h3>Initial view</h3>
		<a href="images/initial-view.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/initial-view-small.png" alt="Initial view"/></a>
		<p>
		The biggest target looks dark because the light is situated at the center of the room, right behind it.<br/>
		You can see the breach in the back wall, and it's outline to help you remember where you left the breach opened.
		</p>
		<h3>After shooting some targets</h3>
		<a href="images/initial-view-aftershooting.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/initial-view-aftershooting-small.png" alt="Initial view after shooting some targets"/></a>
		<p>
		Now the breach is fully visible. It shows a distant scene (well... this is a fake distance scene, a mere target behind the wall).
		</p>
		<h3>A bit of perspective</h3>
		<a href="images/perspective-view-withoutline.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/perspective-view-withoutline-small.png" alt="A perspective view, with the breach outline"/></a>
		<p>
		This view let's you appreciate the lighting of the brushed metal walls and the spacial repartition of the targets.
		</p>
		<h3>Close-up on the breach</h3>
		<a href="images/closeup-withoutline.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/closeup-withoutline-small.png" alt="Close-up on the breach, with the breach outline"/></a>
		<p>
		Here we take a closer view on the breach, its outline and the distant scene.<br/>
		(The distant scene moves, it's not a mere texture for faking distant surroundings, it's more like a window to another world)
		</p>

		<h1><a id="geek">I'm a geek, what is it made of?</a></h1>
		<p>
		Hello geeky, I knew you would come here! Everything's fine 'till now?
		</p>
		<p>
		Breach is a Linux OpenGL software under new BSD licence.<br/>
		It's entirely written in C++ and uses a single makefile to build, test, run, and generate documentation.
		</p>
		<p>
		You may want to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ofavre/Breach/blob/master/INSTALL.textile"><span class="monospaced">INSTALL.textile</span></a> file in the project root.
		</p>

		<h2><a id="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A computer with a graphic card, even a dummy one</li>
			<li>A graphical window manager. Sorry console addicts, this game is not CLI and do not use ncurse or libcaca for rendering...</li>
			<li>Libraries development headers like <span class="monospaced">freeglut3-dev</span>, <span class="monospaced">libpng12-dev</span>, <span class="monospaced">libsigc++-2.0-dev</span> (maybe a bunch of other as well, but I do not depend on them directly)</li>
			<li>Compilation tools like those given by <span class="monospaced">build-essential</span></li>
			<li>Some programming and compilation skills and time, if compilation is problematic</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a id="compiling-running">Compiling and running</a></h2>
		<p>
		Simply issue the following lines:
		</p>
		<pre class="block">cd Breach
make compile
make run</pre>
		<p>
		As compilation is needed for running the game, you may simply issue the last command.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you wish to generate the documentation, issue the following:
		</p>
		<pre class="block">make doc</pre>
		<p>
		You will find the documentation under <span class="monospaced">Breach/doc/html/index.html</span>.<br/>
		If you have a <span style="font-family: times new roman">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</span> distribution,
		you can find the PDF under <span class="monospaced">Breach/doc/latex/refman.pdf</span>.<br/>
		If you don't, the makefile may prompt some harmless errors or warnings, you can safely ignore them.
		</p>
